  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a PhD candidate in the Physics Department at The George Washington University. 
     I study social dynamics and influence using graph learning and operator learning approaches,
     with a particular emphasis on malicious and extremist actors. This work is highly interdisciplinary 
     and serves a broad range of researchers: providing powerful techniques to leverage heterogenous 
     social data to understand and quantify social systems, developing new architectures for solving inverse problems 
     in complex systems physics, and providing novel and high impact use cases for both graph learning and operator 
    learning.

  <h2>Misc</h2>

      In my spare time I enjoy cooking, reading, respiring at regular intervals, ambulating at irregular intervals, 
      and performing a range of mandibular processes including, imbibement, mastocation, and interpersonal transfer of data.
